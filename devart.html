  	<h1 style="line-height: 1.2em;">Methodology for the development of technological artifact</h1>
<h2>Possible steps for applied science</h2>

<p>Any design process usually starts with a brainstorming. Possible "tools" for brainstorming are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Structured reading (it is important to imitatet first)</li>
	<li>Presentations (catch impulses, write diary, present)</li>
	<li>Discussion (spontaneous are often useful, criticize)</li>
	<li>Cooperation (working in groups)</li>
	<li>Experimentation (both with touchables and thoughts)</li>
	<li>Simplification (make assumptions to limit the scope)</li>
	<li>Decomposition (divide a complex problem; 3 actions: measure -> model -> manage)</li>
	<li>Clarification (requirements analysis & specification)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the project work, establish several documents and update them during the project.</p>

<ol>
<li>Provide a short formulation for what a project is, potentially a description of a problem you want to solve, f. ex. "measure the exact time for the drive and recovery phases in a rowing stroke".</li>

<li>Formulate project goals, like <b>performance goals</b>, f. ex. "demonstrate that data from a sensor placed in the force application point (swivel) can be showed on the coach's smartphone screen approximately real-time and satisfies the specification (could be a separate document); do not exceed the budget ..." and some <b>effect goals</b> like "understand better the effectiveness of different rhythms of the stroke in the elite rowing".</li>

<li>Identify the need for the artifact (a thing you want to make, create, build, etc.), f. ex. "there are many rowing styles and coaching cultures and no research has been done about which rhythm of rowing stroke is the most effective one; our artifact will collect data what will be used in an analytic model to estimate the most effective rhythm and also give an instant feedback to the coach and rower under the training").</li>

<li>Analyze the need for the artifact (to find out if the artifact is too compound for a realization and potentially do decomposition, f. ex. instead of aiming for a prototype in a real rowing boat, the starting artifact could be a simulation implemented in a lab).</li>

<li>Document the need for the artifact (it might be a formulation of some success criteria, like "coach and athlete can discover the most effective rhythm to achieve the maximal possible speed in a given situation").</li>

<li>Check out the research front or if someone has already made something similar (your work can also be to prove a concept developed by others by reimplementing the artifact or testing out if the other artifact satisfies the specifications of your artifact; structured reading can be used as a method for this task, f. ex. there is a website https://www.biorow.co.uk/Links to an external site. which describes and sells similar artifacts).</li>

<li>Do planning:</li>
<ul>	
	<li>Make an initial schedule for your project.</li>
	<li>Make a plan for evaluation (many methods to choose from: prototyping, experimental simulation, field experiment, field study, data simulation, maths, logic, questionnaire, interviews, laboratory experiment, etc.); if writing code is a part of your project, you should also develop a plan for testing</li> 

	<li>Make a plan for documentation, - you should strive to document in a way that others might be able to control your results and potentially repeat your investigations and your experiments. <br /> 
Several types of documentation can be considered:
		<ul>
			<li>documentation of the architecture and the structure of the artifact (as detailed architecture as possible)</li>

			<li>documentation of the setup and context for the evaluation of the artifact (f. ex. "using simulation on Arduino Uno to collect and manage data from the sensor in the swivel, including detailed descriptions of the board and swivel components")</li>

			<li>documentation of the type of data related to the artifact (f. ex. "the data from the swivel used in the model X1, is an approximation of the voltage generated by pressure executed on the vertical area of swivel and have the following precision")</li>

			<li>documentation of the materials used in the project (f. ex. "carbon type swivel with resistance parameters n, m, k was used ...")</li>

			<li>documentation of the interpretation and analysis of the data and materials (f. ex. "data was sent by a wireless node to the coach's smartphone and interpreted as float type represented in milliseconds")</li>

			<li>documentation of the argumentations and deductions (based on mathematical analysis, logical deductions or even more informal deduction based on common sense)</li>
			<li>documentation of different tests (you should be familiar with those from other courses)</li>
		</ul>
</ul>
</li>
