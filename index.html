    <h1>About IS-311</h1>
    <p>If considering anything, that is connected to the Internet, be called a "thing", then the <i>Internet of Things</i> has been around since early 1970s when the first deployments of conneceted "things" found place and provided the origins of the Internet as we know it today (anno 2023). To connect a "thing" to the Internet, it has to be designed by a human actor based on a beforehand developed specifications. Knowledge about the specifications and ability to apply it in problem solving are important factors for a designer of "things", which can be connected to the Internet. In addition, an understanding of cultural, economical and even political factors might be required to develop products that can contribute to the welfare (biological, mental and societal) of self and others. Specifications and societal context will be a part of discsussions in IS-311.</p>

    <p>In recent years the cost of design and production of electronical components in the industrial world has decreased and such components have been more accessible to both businesses (organizations) and individuals. That has triggered a considerable increase in both "Do it Yourself"- (individual action) and commercial products (organizational context) resulting in considerable amount of "things" connected to the Internet. Many of these "things" contain sensors that have capabilities to measure and transfer different types of data about their environment.  Availability of these data contributes both to the public good (welfare) and many mallicious activities like stealing encoded information to open/start cars and get access to hotel rooms, and making surveillance of legal persons and stealing personal or classified information. Issues like those will be discussed in IS-311.</p>


    <p>Upcoming systems developers and systems analysts might be specially motivated to learn more about IoT and to get "hands-on" experience with the "things". The plan of IS-311 seeks to offer to the students a time, supervision resources and a selection of electronic components to facilitate creative thinking and problem solving by exploring the phenomenon IoT. </p>

    <p>During 8 weeks we will discuss existing patterns of IoT and provide opportunities to work on prototypes related to real-life problems or to problems that the students have a genuine interest in. The focus will mainly be on the specification of the problem and the following project work.</p>

    <h2>
      Basic concepts
      <a name="concepts"></a>
    </h2>

    <p>According to philosopher Mario Bunge (Bunge & Springerlink (Online Service, 2010)) an artificial information processing unit (IPU) can be fully described by three main components:
<ul>
  <li>(U) a user with a brain trained to operate electronic circuits (computers) and, in particular, to encode and decode messages (to pair symbols to meanings)</li>
  <li>(H) a computer together with its energy source</li>
  <li>(P) a computer program</li>
</ul>
This gives us a formula <code>IPU = U + H + P</code>. In IS-311 you, as a student, will represent the U. H will be a combination of the "things" you already own (computer, mobile phone, ...) and other components of a calculating machine, such as microcontrollers and boards (Wikipedia Contributors, 2023b) . As no action is possible without an energy source and memory, the H comprises a microprocessors (Wikipedia Contributors, 2023c), microcontrollers (Wikipedia Contributors, 2023a), interfaces for input and output together with one or several energy sources (Tan, 2021). The H in our case is always programmable. i.e. can execute several programs. If an electronic device serves a very special purpose (Wikipedia Contributors, 2023d), there are cases when it is only possible to execute one program at time. IoT devices often has limited possibilities to be re-programmed without overwriting the whole code stored in the storage medium ("firmware flashing"). This fact has several consequences, for example, it is not trivial to provide patches for such computing components.</p>

<p>A relevant question is if we need to include a U (user) in an information processing unit? If we instead assume that there can be autonomous agents that do not require any interaction with humans, we are left with H and P. But is it thinkable that the P is also provided without a human interaction? To begin with let us assume that an autonomous agent is comprised of H and P. It is important that in your project you carefully choose that components you want to abstract to in your model. In many cases it is also possible to model with the human as a autonomous agent in an information processing system (system thinking). This discussion will be important in IS-311 in the process of making system requirements for your artifact.</p>


     <p>Now, when we have described the situation very briefly, let us proceed to the learning objectives of the IS-311.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Student have knowledge about models of the Internet of Things currently in use.</td>
    <td>Both "knowledge" and "models" are ambiguous concepts. What does it mean to have a knowledge about something? Let us say that it is to have a mental model in one's brain, that an individuel is able to associate with some specific phenomenon inside himself or in the surroundings (environment). So in this context "knowledge about models" would be a (personally interpreted and therefore psychological) knowledge about other's mental models regarding the phenomenon Internet of Things. Definition in Cambridge Dictionary states that the IoT is <cite>objects with computing devices in them that are able to connect to each other and exchange data using the internet</cite>. According to Oxford English Dictionary the "internet of things" is <cite>a proposed development of the internet in which many everyday objects are embedded with microchips giving them network connectivity, allowing them</cite> [to share data on internet]. Depending on the level of abstraction there are several models that can be adapted. The newest model is that of the two tiers, - edge tier and cloud tier. Processing units with sensors (and potentially actuators) are on the edge (of the network/world) and the data they collect are stored in the cloud (a modern concept of accumulation of data and computing services, both H and P). Edge and cloud communicates through the Internett. All agents (devices, IPUs) have to obey specific standards. An older (steam age from 17th century, but not yet electrical then), and more basic, model is that of telemetry, - the science or practice of obtaining physical measurements or other data at one location and transmitting them (for example by means of electrical signals) to another device for analysis and monitoring. The transmission path can be modelled in different ways (sequentially with data collection with measurement sensors or otherwise, multiplexing system based on frequency, time or hybrid division, modulator, transmitter, antenna, waveform or transmission channel, radio frequency receiver antenna, carrier demodulator, demultiplexing system based on frequency, time or hybrid method, data processing and display). There are many other models developed around IoT, especially those related to the cybersecurity ((Minimum Security Standards: Internet of Things (IoT) Devices | University IT, 2023), (Internet of Things (IoT), 2023), (Dahmen-Lhuissier, 2019), (ISO/IEC 27400:2022 (2022))) that might be worth to be aware of and become familiar with. Since this is only a 5 ECTS course, there will be very little time to discuss those models, guidelines and standards. All models related to the concepts of "smart" (cities, houses) will also have similar destiny in the context of this practical course.</td>

    <td>Understand how a semester project could be related to the projects in the same domain and the society in general.</td>
  <td>"in the same domain" relates to the IoT domain. IoT domain is very wide, so many subdomains can be relevant. Students should be able to relate their project to some basic model of IoT and, if relevant, to how it can contribute to the welfare of oneself and others. The concepts of "sustainability" and "circular economy" can be relevant (Rejeb et al., 2022). There are many project examples for the most popular prototyping boards ((Arduino Project Hub, 2023), (Raspberry Pi, 2023), (The Top 23 Risc v Open Source Projects, 2022)).</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Be able to analyse a problem and, if possible, suggest a solution that uses relevant theories, methods and models in the areas like multi-agent systems and the Internet of Things.</td>
    <td>"a problem" in this context is the problem suggested by students that they want to solve based on their knowledge and skills related to the IoT. Deployments of the electronical devices, which makes the base of the IoT, to a subdomain are grounded in the theory of electromagnetism, but in the hyped IoT context theories specific to the suggested subdomain can also be relevant (multi-agent systems, game theory, computational theories, theories from informations systems field, ...). From the engineering perspectiv methods from systems development are relevant for IoT projects (IS-104, IS-114, IS-20x). In addition, methods for applied science should be known for students. Read an <a href="devart.html" target="_blank">additional document</a> for an introduction to a possible methodology for the development of artifacts. You can also take a look at some guidelines about the processes for the design and develompment of "things" for "taking a them to the market". (Teel, 2016).</td>

      Tentative plan
      <a name="plan"></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>8 x 13 hours - total for 5 ECTS</li>
        <li>8 x 3 hours - acitivities with supervision</li>
        <li>~80 hours - self-organized project work (groups should plan for this carefully)</li>
      </ul>
    The course is based on meetings for creative thinking and problem solving. The students generate groups of 3-6 students by themselves, work on finding a relevant project (specifies the problem to be solved) and work on prototypes. Any other week the groups present their project status in fora (4 presentations). At the end of the course an oral exam is arranged to evaluate the students' work. </p>
